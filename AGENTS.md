## ProtoPulse

Native desktop AI-assisted EDA (Electronic Design Automation) platform — the all-in-one suite for makers, learners, hobbyists, and anyone working with microcontrollers, electronics, robotics, or embedded systems. Originally browser-based, ProtoPulse has pivoted to a pure-local native desktop application to enable uncompromised hardware access (USB/serial, native toolchains, local filesystems). The vision is TinkerCad Circuits + Fritzing + KiCad + Wokwi + Arduino IDE unified into a single AI-powered experience where you never have to leave the tool. Not tied to any specific project — ProtoPulse is meant to be the tool you reach for regardless of what you're building.

**Origin story:** Born from the OmniTrek Nexus rover project (Arduino Mega, NodeMCU ESP32, RioRand motor controllers, salvaged hoverboard wheels) where no single tool covered the full journey from "I don't know electronics" to "here are my Gerbers." That frustration became the mission: build one tool that does everything for any electronics/robotics/embedded project.

**Current capabilities:** Architecture block diagrams, circuit schematic editor, BOM management, design validation (DRC/ERC), AI chat with 118 AI tools, multi-format export (KiCad, Eagle, SPICE, Gerber, drill, pick-and-place, design report, FMEA, firmware scaffold, PDF), AC/DC/transient simulation, Monte Carlo tolerance analysis, generative circuit design, WebGPU acceleration, digital twin with IoT telemetry, Web Serial hardware communication, engineering calculators, 3D board viewer, PCB ordering, undo/redo, project ownership, design history, backup/restore, offline PWA, collaboration.

**Where it's heading:** See `docs/MASTER_BACKLOG.md` for the single source of truth on all future work, tech debt, and feature ideas.

### CRITICAL PLATFORM CONTEXT: NATIVE DESKTOP APPLICATION

ProtoPulse has officially pivoted from a browser-based/hybrid platform to a Pure-Local Native Desktop Application.

- **Do NOT** constrain your solutions to browser-only web APIs.
- **DO** assume full, unhindered access to the Node.js environment, the local file system, native compilation toolchains (like the Arduino CLI), and physical hardware (USB/serial ports).
- When implementing firmware compilation, hardware debugging, or project saving features, utilize native desktop capabilities rather than attempting to build web-to-local communication bridges.

**Operational Note:** Do not create local CLAUDE.md files to reiterate these rules in subdirectories, as it will accelerate context compaction and kill parallel agent teammates.

## Stack

React 19 + TypeScript 5.6 + Vite 7 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (New York dark theme) + @xyflow/react | Express 5 + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM + TanStack React Query | AI: Google Genkit (gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools + gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview) via SSE streaming | Testing: Vitest 4 + happy-dom + Tauri v2 (native desktop)

## Build & Commands

| Task | Command | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| Dev server | `npm run dev` | Express + Vite on port 5000 |
| Dev client only | `npm run dev:client` | Vite dev server on port 5000 |
| Production build | `npm run build` | Vite + esbuild (`tsx script/build.ts`) |
| Start production | `npm start` | Runs pre-built `dist/index.cjs` |
| Type check | `npm run check` | `tsc` — **must pass with zero errors** |
| Run all tests | `npm test` | `vitest run` (server + client projects) |
| Tests (watch) | `npm run test:watch` | `vitest` interactive mode |
| Tests + coverage | `npm run test:coverage` | `vitest run --coverage` (v8 provider) |
| Single test file | `npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts` | |
| Tests by name | `npx vitest run -t "test name"` | |
| Server tests only | `npx vitest run --project server` | node environment |
| Client tests only | `npx vitest run --project client` | happy-dom environment |
| DB sync | `npm run db:push` | Drizzle schema → PostgreSQL |
| Lint | `npx eslint .` | ESLint strict TypeScript + React |
| Format | `npx prettier --write .` | Prettier formatting |

### Critical Rules

- `npm run check` **must** pass with zero errors after every change — fix ALL TypeScript errors immediately
- `npm test` should pass — verify no regressions after changes
- Never dismiss any error as "pre-existing" or "unrelated"

### MANDATORY FRONTEND VERIFICATION

Starting immediately, all frontend/UI/UX modifications MUST be tested and fully verified using **Chrome DevTools** (browser automation) **BEFORE** continuing.

1.  **NO EXCEPTIONS:** No UI change is considered complete until verified in a live browser.
2.  **EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE:** You must provide proof of verification (e.g., console log checks, DOM element inspection via `get_screen`, or visual verification via `take_screenshot`).
3.  **AUTO-VERIFY:** Use `chrome-devtools` MCP tools to automate the validation of your changes.
4.  **REPRODUCE FIRST:** For UI bugs, you must first verify the failure in the browser before applying a fix.
5.  **POST-FIX VALIDATION:** After every UI edit, refresh the page (or navigate) and verify the fix behaves as expected.

## Code Style

### Formatting (Prettier — `.prettierrc`)

- Semicolons: always
- Quotes: single
- Tab width: 2 spaces
- Trailing commas: all
- Print width: 120
- Bracket spacing: true
- Arrow parens: always

### ESLint (`eslint.config.js` — flat config)

- Base: `strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked` from typescript-eslint
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: **error** (off in test files)
- `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports`: **error** — `import type { ... }` enforced
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: **error** — `_` prefix allowed
- `prefer-const`: **error**
- `eqeqeq`: always (no `==`)
- `curly`: always (no braceless blocks)
- `no-console`: warn (off in `server/` and test files)
- Import ordering enforced via `eslint-plugin-import-x`: builtin → external → internal → parent → sibling → index → type
- `import-x/no-duplicates`: **error**
- `import-x/consistent-type-specifier-style`: **error** — prefer top-level
- Prettier handles all formatting (eslint-config-prettier disables formatting rules)

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode** — `strict: true` in tsconfig.json, no exceptions
- **Path aliases**: `@/*` → `client/src/*`, `@shared/*` → `shared/*`
- **No `as any`** — Use proper type narrowing, generics, or discriminated unions
- **Zod for validation** — Runtime validation on API boundaries, schema inference for types
- **Type imports**: `import type { ... }` for type-only imports (ESLint enforced)
- **Module**: ESNext with bundler resolution

### React Patterns

- **React 19** — Functional components only, hooks-based, JSX runtime (no React import needed)
- **State**: TanStack React Query for server state, React context for client state
- **No Redux/Zustand/MobX** — Only React Query + context
- **`data-testid`** on every interactive and display element
- **Node IDs**: `crypto.randomUUID()`, never `Date.now()`
- **Exhaustive switches** on discriminated unions — extract shared base properties before the switch to avoid `never` type issues in default cases
- **Styling**: shadcn/ui components + `cn()` utility for Tailwind classes. Theme is Dark with Neon Cyan (`#00F0FF`)

### Naming Conventions

- React components: PascalCase (`ArchitectureView.tsx`)
- Hooks: `use` prefix (`useProject`, `useMobile`)
- Event handlers: `handle` prefix in components (`handleClick`), `on` prefix for props (`onClick`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for module-level, camelCase for scoped
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- Test IDs: `{action}-{target}` pattern (e.g., `button-submit`)

### Import Order (ESLint enforced)

1. React/framework imports
2. Third-party library imports
3. Internal path-aliased imports (`@/`, `@shared/`)
4. Relative imports
5. Type imports last (via `import type`)

### Error Handling

- **Server**: `asyncHandler` wrapper + `HttpError` class with status codes + `StorageError` class
- **Client**: React Query global `onError` with toast notifications (sonner)
- **ErrorBoundary** around each view in ProjectWorkspace
- **Zod**: `fromZodError()` for user-friendly validation messages

## Development Pattern

**Vertical slice** — always implement top-to-bottom:

1. Types/schema in `shared/schema.ts` (with Zod insert schema + inferred types)
2. Storage methods in `server/storage.ts` (implement `IStorage` interface)
3. API routes in `server/routes.ts` (Zod validation, asyncHandler)
4. React Query hooks in `client/src/lib/project-context.tsx`
5. UI components in `client/src/components/`
6. Add `data-testid` to every interactive and display element

## Testing

### Framework & Configuration

- **Framework**: Vitest 4 with workspace projects
- **Client tests**: `happy-dom` environment, `@testing-library/react`, setup file `client/src/test-setup.ts`
- **Server tests**: `node` environment
- **Coverage**: `@vitest/coverage-v8` — reports to `coverage/` directory
- **Legacy**: `server/__tests__/api.test.ts` uses `node:test` runner (excluded from Vitest config)

### Test File Locations (474 test files)

```text
server/__tests__/                          → API, auth, storage, exporters, generators, DRC, LRU cache, metrics, audit-log, circuit-breaker, stream-abuse, auth-regression, storage-transactions (30 files)
client/src/lib/__tests__/                  → Utility tests
client/src/lib/contexts/__tests__/         → React context tests (architecture, BOM, chat, history)
client/src/lib/circuit-editor/__tests__/   → Wire router, breadboard model, ERC engine
client/src/lib/simulation/__tests__/       → SPICE generator, circuit solver
client/src/lib/component-editor/__tests__/ → Constraint solver, diff engine, snap engine
client/src/components/panels/__tests__/    → ChatPanel tests
client/src/components/layout/__tests__/    → Sidebar tests
client/src/components/views/__tests__/     → Architecture, Procurement, Validation view tests
shared/__tests__/                          → Schema validation, DRC engine tests
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                                    # All tests (server + client)
npm run test:watch                          # Interactive watch mode
npm run test:coverage                       # With v8 coverage report
npx vitest run --project server             # Server tests only
npx vitest run --project client             # Client tests only
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts         # Single file
npx vitest run -t "test name"              # By test name
```

### Testing Philosophy

**When tests fail, fix the code, not the test.**

- Tests should be meaningful — avoid tests that always pass regardless of behavior
- Test actual functionality — call the functions being tested
- Failing tests are valuable — they reveal bugs or missing features
- Fix the root cause — when a test fails, fix the underlying issue
- Test edge cases — tests that reveal limitations help improve the code

## Security

- **Auth**: Session-based via `X-Session-Id` header (not cookies)
- **API keys**: AES-256-GCM encryption at rest, scrypt for password hashing
- **CSP**: Content-Security-Policy via Helmet middleware
- **Rate limiting**: `express-rate-limit` on API endpoints
- **Security headers**: `helmet` middleware on Express
- **Soft deletes**: Data preservation — `deletedAt` timestamp, never hard delete
- **Never expose/log secrets or API keys**
- **All `window.open()` calls**: Include `noopener,noreferrer`

### Known Security Findings (from product analysis)

See `docs/product-analysis-checklist.md` for full security findings (CAPX-SEC-*). Key P0 items:

- CORS dynamic origin reflection — needs allowlist
- XSS via `javascript:` URIs in AI markdown — needs protocol validation
- ZIP bomb vulnerability in FZPZ import — needs decompressed size check
- Missing `process.on('uncaughtException')` handler

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | AES-256-GCM key for stored API keys |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default 5000) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Winston logger level |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | development/production |

### TypeScript Config

- `strict: true`, `noEmit: true` (check only, Vite handles emit)
- `module: ESNext`, `moduleResolution: bundler`
- `jsx: preserve` (React 19 auto JSX transform)
- Path aliases: `@/*` → `client/src/*`, `@shared/*` → `shared/*`
- Includes: `client/src/**/*`, `shared/**/*`, `server/**/*`

## Guardrails

- **ALWAYS use `/agent-teams`** (real Claude Code agent teams with in-process teammates, Shift+Up/Down navigation, shared task list) for ALL parallel implementation work. NEVER use background `Agent` subagents for implementation. Subagents are ONLY for read-only research/exploration.
- Never swap Wouter, Drizzle, shadcn/ui, @xyflow/react, or TanStack Query; these are core
- Never add Redux/Zustand/MobX; use React Query + context
- Never silently change API response shapes; update all callers
- Never delete routes/tables without updating all references
- Never change ID column types (serial ↔ varchar); breaks migrations
- Never expose or log secrets/API keys
- Never bypass the `IStorage` interface (`server/storage.ts`)
- Keep the app working at all times — small, incremental changes only

## Gotchas

- **Soft deletes**: `projects`, `architecture_nodes`, `architecture_edges`, `bom_items` use `deletedAt` — always filter with `isNull(deletedAt)` in queries
- **Auth uses header**: `X-Session-Id`, not cookies
- **AI system prompt** rebuilds full project state (all nodes, edges, BOM, validation, chat) on every request — O(N) sequential queries (known performance debt GA-DB-01)
- **Cache**: LRU eviction policy. Invalidation uses prefix matching: invalidating `"nodes:1"` clears all keys starting with `"nodes:1"`
- **Node IDs**: Use `crypto.randomUUID()`, not `Date.now()`
- **BOM totalPrice**: Computed server-side from `quantity * unitPrice`
- **Deprecated endpoints**: `/api/bom/:id` and `/api/validation/:id` still exist — prefer `/api/projects/:id/bom/:bomId`
- **Response envelope inconsistency**: DELETEs return 204 in routes.ts but `{ success: true }` in circuit-routes.ts (GA-API-03)
- **No API versioning**: All routes at `/api/*` with no version prefix
- **Legacy test**: `server/__tests__/api.test.ts` uses `node:test` (not Vitest) — excluded from `npm test`

## Agent Mindset

**Be proactive, curious, creative, and communicative.** Think like a senior engineer building a tool for someone who's learning electronics and building real hardware projects.

- **The user is the target user.** He's learning electronics while building a rover. Every feature should be evaluated through the lens of: "Would this help a maker who doesn't have a formal EE background?"
- **Accessibility over complexity.** Prefer intuitive, visual, interactive implementations over technically impressive but opaque ones. If a feature requires the user to already understand electronics to use it, it's not done yet — add AI guidance, tooltips, or a learning mode.
- **One tool, zero context-switching.** The core value prop is never having to leave ProtoPulse. If a workflow currently requires an external tool (calculator, datasheet lookup, code editor, serial monitor), that's a gap worth closing.
- Draw inspiration from **TinkerCad Circuits, Fritzing, EveryCircuit, Falstad, Wokwi** (learning/maker tools) as much as from KiCad, Altium, Figma, VS Code (pro tools)
- After every task, actively look for related improvements nearby in the code you touched
- After meaningful changes, provide an **Improvements Radar** (3-7 ideas: Quick Win / Medium / Big Swing)
- Be direct and opinionated. Quantify technical debt impact. Flag issues early.
- Always check audit checklists before starting work — kill two birds with one stone
