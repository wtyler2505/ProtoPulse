## EXECUTE NOW

**Target: $ARGUMENTS**

The target MUST be a file path. If no target provided, list inbox/ contents and ask which to seed.

### Step 0: Read Vocabulary

Read `ops/derivation-manifest.md` (or fall back to `ops/derivation.md`) for domain vocabulary mapping. All output must use domain-native terms. If neither file exists, use universal terms.

**START NOW.** Seed the source file into the processing queue.

---

## Step 1: Validate Source

Confirm the target file exists. If it does not, check common locations:
- `inbox/{filename}`
- Subdirectories of inbox/

If the file cannot be found, report error and stop:
```
ERROR: Source file not found: {path}
Checked: {locations checked}
```

Read the file to understand:
- **Content type**: what kind of material is this? (research article, documentation, transcript, etc.)
- **Size**: line count (affects chunking decisions in /extract)
- **Format**: markdown, plain text, structured data

## Step 2: Duplicate Detection

Check if this source has already been processed. Two levels of detection:

### 2a. Filename Match

Search the queue file and archive folders for matching source names:

```bash
SOURCE_NAME=$(basename "$FILE" .md | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

# Check queue for existing entry (the queue lives at ops/queue/queue.json)
grep -l "$SOURCE_NAME" ops/queue/queue.json 2>/dev/null

# Check archive folders
ls -d ops/queue/archive/*-${SOURCE_NAME}* 2>/dev/null
```

### 2b. Content Similarity (if semantic search available)

If semantic search is available (qmd MCP tools or CLI), check for content overlap:

```
mcp__qmd__qmd_search query="claims from {source filename}" limit=5
```

Or via keyword search in the knowledge/ directory:
```bash
grep -rl "{key terms from source title}" knowledge/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

### 2c. Report Duplicates

If either check finds a match:
- Show what was found (filename match or content overlap)
- Ask: "This source may have been processed before. Proceed anyway? (y/n)"
- If the user declines, stop cleanly
- If the user confirms (or no duplicate found), continue

## Step 3: Create Archive Structure

Create the archive folder. The date-prefixed folder name ensures uniqueness.

```bash
DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d")
SOURCE_BASENAME=$(basename "$FILE" .md | tr ' ' '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCHIVE_DIR="ops/queue/archive/${DATE}-${SOURCE_BASENAME}"
mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_DIR"
```

The archive folder serves two purposes:
1. Permanent home for the source file (moved from inbox)
2. Destination for task files after batch completion (/archive-batch moves them here)

## Step 4: Move Source to Archive

Move the source file from its current location to the archive folder. This is the **claiming step** — once moved, the source is owned by this processing batch.

**inbox sources get moved:**
```bash
if [[ "$FILE" == *"inbox"* ]]; then
  mv "$FILE" "$ARCHIVE_DIR/"
  FINAL_SOURCE="$ARCHIVE_DIR/$(basename "$FILE")"
fi
```

**Sources outside inbox stay in place:**
```bash
# Living docs (like configuration files) stay where they are
# Archive folder is still created for task files
FINAL_SOURCE="$FILE"
```

Use `$FINAL_SOURCE` in the task file — this is the path all downstream phases reference.

**Why move immediately:** All references (task files, knowledge notes' Source footers) use the final archived path from the start. No path updates needed later. If it is in inbox, it is unclaimed. Claimed sources live in archive.

## Step 5: Determine Claim Numbering

Find the highest existing claim number across ALL three locations — live task files, the queue, and archived batches — to ensure globally unique claim IDs. Scanning only one location causes claim-number collisions.

```bash
# (a) Live claim task files sitting in the queue directory
LIVE_MAX=$(find ops/queue -maxdepth 1 -name "*-[0-9][0-9][0-9].md" 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -v summary | sed 's/.*-\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\)\.md$/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1)
LIVE_MAX=${LIVE_MAX:-0}

# (b) Task "file" fields referenced in the queue (ops/queue/queue.json)
QUEUE_MAX=$(jq -r '.tasks[].file // empty' ops/queue/queue.json 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -oE '[0-9]{3}\.md$' | grep -oE '^[0-9]{3}' | sort -n | tail -1)
QUEUE_MAX=${QUEUE_MAX:-0}

# (c) Archived batches
ARCHIVE_MAX=$(find ops/queue/archive -name "*-[0-9][0-9][0-9].md" 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -v summary | sed 's/.*-\([0-9][0-9][0-9]\)\.md$/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1)
ARCHIVE_MAX=${ARCHIVE_MAX:-0}

# Next claim starts after the max of all three.
# 10# forces decimal — zero-padded values like 009 would otherwise parse as octal.
MAX=$(printf '%s\n' "$LIVE_MAX" "$QUEUE_MAX" "$ARCHIVE_MAX" | sort -n | tail -1)
NEXT_CLAIM_START=$((10#$MAX + 1))
```

Claim numbers are globally unique and never reused across batches. This ensures every claim file name (`{source}-{NNN}.md`) is unique vault-wide.

## Step 6: Create Extract Task File

Write the task file to `ops/queue/${SOURCE_BASENAME}.md`:

```markdown
---
id: {SOURCE_BASENAME}
type: extract
source: {FINAL_SOURCE}
original_path: {original file path before move}
archive_folder: {ARCHIVE_DIR}
created: {UTC timestamp}
next_claim_start: {NEXT_CLAIM_START}
---

# Extract insights from {source filename}

## Source
Original: {original file path}
Archived: {FINAL_SOURCE}
Size: {line count} lines
Content type: {detected type}

## Scope
{scope guidance if provided via --scope, otherwise: "Full document"}

## Acceptance Criteria
- Extract claims, implementation ideas, tensions, and testable hypotheses
- Duplicate check against knowledge/ during extraction
- Near-duplicates create enrichment tasks (do not skip)
- Each output type gets appropriate handling

## Execution Notes
(filled by /extract)

## Outputs
(filled by /extract)
```

## Step 7: Update Queue

Add the extract task entry to the `tasks` array of the queue file (`ops/queue/queue.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "{SOURCE_BASENAME}",
  "type": "extract",
  "status": "pending",
  "source": "{FINAL_SOURCE}",
  "file": "{SOURCE_BASENAME}.md",
  "created": "{UTC timestamp}",
  "next_claim_start": {NEXT_CLAIM_START}
}
```

**If no queue file exists:** Create `ops/queue/queue.json` with the appropriate schema header (phase_order definitions) and this first task entry.

## Step 8: Report

```
--=={ seed }==--

Seeded: {SOURCE_BASENAME}
Source: {original path} -> {FINAL_SOURCE}
Archive folder: {ARCHIVE_DIR}
Size: {line count} lines
Content type: {detected type}

Task file: ops/queue/{SOURCE_BASENAME}.md
Claims will start at: {NEXT_CLAIM_START}
Claim files will be: {SOURCE_BASENAME}-{NNN}.md (unique across vault)
Queue: updated with extract task

Next steps:
  /ralph 1 --batch {SOURCE_BASENAME}     (extract claims)
  /pipeline will handle this automatically
```

---

## Why This Skill Exists

Manual queue management is error-prone. This skill:
- Ensures consistent task file format across batches
- Handles claim numbering automatically (globally unique)
- Checks for duplicates before creating unnecessary work
- Moves sources to their permanent archive location immediately
- Provides clear next steps for the user

## Naming Convention

Task files use the source basename for human readability:
- Task file: `{source-basename}.md`
- Claim files: `{source-basename}-{NNN}.md`
- Summary: `{source-basename}-summary.md`
- Archive folder: `{date}-{source-basename}/`

Claim numbers (NNN) are globally unique across all batches, ensuring every filename is unique vault-wide. This is required because wiki links resolve by filename, not path.

## Source Handling Patterns

**inbox source (most common):**
```
inbox/research/article.md
    | /seed
    v
ops/queue/archive/2026-01-30-article/article.md  <- source moved here
ops/queue/article.md                               <- task file created
```

**Living doc (outside inbox):**
```
CLAUDE.md -> stays as CLAUDE.md (no move)
ops/queue/archive/2026-01-30-claude-md/           <- folder still created
ops/queue/claude-md.md                             <- task file created
```

When /archive-batch runs later, it moves task files into the existing archive folder and generates a summary.

---

## Edge Cases

**Source outside inbox:** Works — source stays in place, archive folder is created for task files only.

**No queue file:** Create `ops/queue/queue.json` with schema header and this first entry.

**Large source (2500+ lines):** Note in output: "Large source ({N} lines) -- /extract will chunk automatically."

**Source is a URL or non-file:** Report error: "/seed requires a file path."

**No ops/derivation-manifest.md:** Use universal vocabulary for all output.

---

## Critical Constraints

**never:**
- Skip duplicate detection (prevents wasted processing)
- Move a source that is not in inbox (living docs stay in place)
- Reuse claim numbers from previous batches (globally unique is required)
- Create a task file without updating the queue (both must happen together)

**always:**
- Ask before proceeding when duplicates are detected
- Create the archive folder even for living docs (task files need it)
- Use the archived path (not original) in the task file for inbox sources
- Report next steps clearly so the user knows what to do next
- Compute next_claim_start from live task files, queue.json, AND archived batches (max of all three)
